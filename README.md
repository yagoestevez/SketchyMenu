# CodePen Challenge on Menus /June 2018/

This is a fun side project for a CodePen Challenge on the last week of June 2018.

Participants were presented with an HTML menu structure and they were required to make anything with it. So I decided to use SVG animation with SnapSVG for the morphing.

Here you have the [demo](https://yagoestevez.github.io/SketchyMenu/).

Challenge is over!
